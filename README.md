# Introduction
Vivaldi is a browser specifically designed for power users and people who love the Web. Since its launch, several users have been creating and providing tricks to improve Vivaldi's user experience. The goal of this repository is to gather all the tricks in one place, making it accessible for anyone who wants to customise their Vivaldi Browser.


**Notice:** Most (all) of these tricks are not my creation. I always try to give credits to the author. If you are the author of one of these tricks, and wish me to remove your trick(s) from this rep, please contact me by e-mail: rvieira[at]vivaldi.net.
