Below is the code which matches the above screenshot, plus the 2 supplementary pics which it needs in order to display the Bookmark Star.

You will need to save those 2 pics too.

The code makes a somewhat large file (~11KB), as it contains quite a few explanation remarks, in order to help those who might wish to try to tweak or modify it.

Code statements in the file are organized to appear in the order in which they actually appear in the UI, starting at the top left of the UI, and covering one toolbar at a time.

**It has only been tested on Windows Vista Home Basic 32-bit with SP2.**

My most recent test of this theme is continuing with Vivaldi Build 174, and previously with TP3 (updated info).

**It is only intended to be used in a Maximized Window, when Vivaldi's Settings have all 3 toolbars positioned at the Top.**

Thanks to An_dz for the help in getting this project started ! :)

These are the 2 pics :

    This block of code does the following in a Maximized Window, when Vivaldi's Settings have all 3 toolbars positioned at the Top :
    (1) Hides the Title Bar,
    (2) Merges the Menu bar and Address Bar,
    (3) Positions the Tabs Bar immediately above the web page content,
    (4) Slims the height of the resultant 3 top bars, to give more vertical space for your web pages,
    (5) Moves the Add Bookmark Button and Popup to the left of the Address Box,
    (6) Moves 2 other buttons from the Tab Bar to the left of the Address Box,
    (7) Adds a few Borders and Margins.
